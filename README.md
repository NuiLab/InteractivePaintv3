Interactive Paint is a showcase of what can be done using input devices such as the Intel RealSense, Leap Motion, Kinect and Multi-touch Display. It also serves as a framework for future projects involving these input devices.

Interactive Paint allows users to draw to a canvas just like Microsoft Paint but it allows you to do so with a variety of input devices. Drawing can be done with a mouse as well as a Multi-touch Display but it can also be done using the hand tracking functionality of these input devices. 

This application can also be controlled using the various gestures supported by the input devices. While not all supported gestures are used in the application, they are being recognized by the application and can be given functionality in future iterations.
